About GLug'at-1.91 (reanimated)

Purpose: Dictionary application.

Implementation:
GLug'at was written using C++ STL and GTK+-3.0 libraries. 
It uses four data files(in fact five). One of them consists list of english words, 
and another one translations, third is for phonetic transcriptions and the last one is
thesaurus. All files should be located in working directory where application is located or 
You may change it in source code by entering absolute path to them.
When user enters word, application first searches it in list if not found 
then it looks up it in file. Whole words or part of them can be entered.
